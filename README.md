# An Interactive Task Tracker Program Using MVC Architecture

The program has a terminal-based interface where the user types different commands to interact with the program. The goal was to develop such interface functionality that prints information from the Model to the terminal, waits for user to type a command, identifies the command, and calls Controller to perform corresponding action to manipulate the data.

## How to run the project
Run the void `main` method in the `Interface` class.
Enter specified commands in the terminal. In order to ensure that unit tests run correctly, please reset the JVM.
